ABSTRACT
The Mobile networks deploy and offers a multiaspective approach for various resource allocation paradigms and the service based options in the computing segments with its implication in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) and the virtual reality. The Mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm runs the virtual source with the edge communication between data terminals and the execution in the core network with a high pressure load. The demand to meet all the customer requirements is a better way for planning the execution with the support of cognitive agent. The user data with its behavioral approach is clubbed together to fulfill the service type for IIOT. The swarm intelligence based and reinforcement learning techniques provide a neural caching for the memory within the task execution, the prediction provides the caching strategy and cache business that delay the execution. The factors affecting this delay are predicted with mobile edge computing resources and to assess the performance in the neighboring user equipment. The effectiveness builds a cognitive agent model to assess the resource allocation and the communication network is established to enhance the quality of service. The Reinforcement Learning techniques Multi Objective Ant Colony Optimization (MOACO) algorithms has been applied to deal with the accurate resource allocation between the end users in the way of creating the cost mapping tables creations and optimal allocation in MEC.

1. Introduction
The IoT based industry has enormous growth in urban planning with the foundation in the development of an industry for chips, Microcontroller kit, electronic gadgets and telecommunication systems forming a shape in the industrial segments. The attacks and vulnerable issues are the main concern in the IoT with the network breach. The vulnerability can be suspected with Intrusion Detection System that can encounter the anomalies with the reliable services of IoT applications. The various deep learning modelshave been proposed with the modeling scheme of learning and data from sensors form the structure of the setup. The Internet for sharing of communication and contents with a global communication established the objects connected and smart devices with the support of International Data Corporation (IDC) [1]. IoT paved the part of smart city with the support in optimization and enhancing the public services in a smarter way leading to smart transportation, smart parking, smart hospitalization and Urban development [2].
In Mobile edge computing based cloud setup IoT data gathering includes all data to be gathered from the remote server. The remote

processing has been done in an emerging area with the bandwidth usage with the increased speed [3]. The fog computing and data processing have been done from the remote servers that increases the benefits of the data size and the low latency simulation in the filtered server data. The edge computing offers a very big offloading and the storage accuracy have been enriched with the privacy preservation in a smart way of IoT prediction [4].
In the Modern era people are getting connected to the real world through the online sector having an integrated circuit technology and wireless communication have been established with the signal acquisition and data preprocessing with the wireless communication capabilities. The IoT has been divided into three layers such as perception layer, network layer and application layer [5]. The Perception layer deals with the end devices and tail nodes [6]. The End devices monitor a progressive approach in elaborating the segment with the layer channel in the devices to support the RFID tags, Cameras and GPS devices. The sensors are being used by the parameters to form a environment in the sensing layer with the information from the

physical world with analog-to-digital conversion [7]. The second phase of the IoT deals with the network layer which connects the sensing layer to the application layer that includes mobile communication and fixed communication using internet and private communication networks. The network layer includes various functionalities includes optical fiber communication, security access and satellite access [8]. The network layer deals with the applications in the application layer, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) are one of the biggest applications that retrieve the data from the valuable environment. The end devices include the IoT data retrieval from the environment with a information security and business domain. The security includes the analyses of data, compute, store and various technologies. The transmission of data communication is done between the end devices and sensors.
The traditional IoT has the senor analysis of the data in the cloud based server with the process of identifying the key areas in the approach with the similar scalability issues and with the support of the network it has a refined data in the scalability issues in the refined condition having a separate module of the implementation with the draft of assuming the condition in the prescribed section and the technique to be assumed of the performance enhancement in the assumed transcription.
The technique of the IoT has to process the information with the offered needs in the environment with the multi interface needs in the process of adding the WSN networks to as simulate the control in the cellular base station. The WSN has the need based approach in the edge server having a cellular network in the fringed sector any time with the control plane offering a data based control in the needs of the network. The data sent to the network in the WSN has the edge monitoring has to be accomplished with the cellular network coverage in the prescribed assumptions [9]. The edge server is one of the opted cellular base stations in the network which consists of the connections of the IoT device with the data volatility as shown in Fig. 1.
The Edge computing supports the traditional cloud computing and fog computing with a desire to focus on the recent articles that investigate various fog computing with different IoT applications [10]. The IoT challenges are resolved using the edge connecting devices and hence the data segment may be achieved during the various IoT applications in the future research directions in the IoT metrics. The more paradigm shift will be done in an analysis in the future of IoT with various segments in the metrics for evaluating the future research analysis on the issues spread over in the deliverables of the fog based IoT mentors.
The most major problem is the creation of the adaptive mechanism in IIOT with MEC in resource allocation. The cognitive agent is an intelligent mechanism that supports the alternative sources for the resources in IoT with two terminologies that high performance should be guaranteed with the energy should be reserved with the strategy with

the resource allocation. The examinable performance can be monitored with the response time, transmission time or security level. The prestored mapping is a cost effective approach to mitigate the energy optimization in the input task and the accurate energy prediction is retained within the approachable survey of contents. The mapping has the available computer node based on the data types and the data headers.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the predominant approaches which predict the optimal control to enhance the performance with the support of the connected devices.
The energy supply is assumed to be of in the hardware controls, network availability with its usage, congestion, jamming and spoofing in the network. The edge computing is also performed with the predefined devices based on the available feedback criteria are the two major criteria analysis engaged in the analysis of the secular environment and the feature based edge computing is also a developing paradigm [11]. The RL mechanism outlines the impact on the extended smart work in the quality of feedback mechanism (QoF). The QoF establishes the feedback mechanism with the dynamic cost mapping table and the computation cost is associated with the input mask that has been determined with the estimation of the user side in the performance for the value of the work in the AI intelligence. The Low Cost system design set up enables the mapping process in an elaborate way to access the RL algorithm for the process of setting up the table with the values in the current state. The current state has been monitored based on the quality of feedback derived from RL. The low cost establishes a state path allocation that establishes a network in allocating the resources with the associated values.
The dynamic RL based mechanism is the efficient resource allocation, since the network operator allocates the necessary resources based on the traffic changes. Besides it is a big process and cannot estimate the optimization in establishing the resource where it cannot be estimated with the single management process or single entity. The network may offer multiple entities sharing the resources in multiple paradigms; this dynamic process includes a very high computational cost. In such cases MOACO may support the optimal solution in considering the future real-world scenario.
Hence, the cognitive agent is designed to dynamically design a decision based on the task allocated within the surrounding actions, task and current state. The proposed RL based resource allocation in IoT is done with the data capture from dynamic heterogeneous data sources. The proposed approach for resource utilization has the ability to address the range of RL in terms of energy efficiency and throughput maximization than other mechanisms. The dynamic RL is also the best option for the device to device communication for the LTE network in terms of channel allocation approach too.
The main contributions of the work includes,
1. The paper impacts a novel approach to provide a RL solution to the resource allocation using IIoT. The dynamic programming along with the MOACO algorithm proposes a strategic allocation in the dynamic environment to address the challenge in the performance enhancement.
2. The mapping tables are used with the QoF for analyzing the effective performance and the optimal resource allocation in the periodical set up. The feedback, action and reward are used to outline the value function in RL with the level of QoF rewards and the action point monitoring in the communication networks.
3. The QoS is enabled with the cognitive ability to provide a collaboration of the resource for the interaction of edge computing users and joint optimization between the caching resources. The network resources are assumed to be on the IIoT utilization with the concurrent resources.

The task optimization process is explained in the Fig. 4 as the resource utilization enlarges the IIoT MEC device data connections. In Fig. 4, cognitive agent in the application utilizes the resource optimizer for mapping the resource table updation where the task is analyzed with the available resource and hence the allocation is based on with the end user. The rewards are utilized for the task optimization. The cognitive agent communicates with the server using the communication network and hence the agent supplies the task scheduling with the current state to allocate the work flow for the various resources in an efficient manner.

𝑅𝑊 (𝑇𝑗 ) denotes the reward with the task allocation for i nodes and the 𝑅𝑊 (𝑇 𝐴𝑗 )|𝐴𝐶𝑁𝑖 = 𝑎 action is assumed to be of the reward of the nodes for the computation nodes in the low cost for all the action mechanism. The layer mechanism for the data processing has been explained in Fig. 5 as illustrated in the different analysis. In Fig. 5, the three modules used are the (a) data input layer (b) data management layer (c) data analytics layer and the (d) resource management layer. The input layer deals with the process of connecting the edge devices and the input are given for the optimizer for performing the preprocessing and processing of data. The management layer deals the data processing with the modified segment for processing in the execution with allocation and storage of the current stated data. The resource management performs the operation with the task allocation and the state for the RL based mechanism. Finally, the data is analyzed with the task for resource utilization in MEC paradigm.
The path of all the nodes is estimated with the action in the reward mechanism for all the computational rewards from the root node till the child node [50]. The reinforcement learning resolves the computational modules in the action for the reward setup with the incoming task setup is estimated accordingly as shown in Eq. (6)

Furthermore, the defined policy is returned with the reward calculation for the resource allocation strategy. Thus the 𝑅𝑊𝐾 (𝑎) has the reward value in the state of action in the predominant way of establishing the maximum number of nodes with the policy to implement the reward in the allocation of the action. The expected value of the action taken has been considered with the state and the policy 𝛽 as shown in Eq. (7)

The nodes estimation has been performed with the cognitive agent parameter and the service nodes are highly monitored with the proper alignment in the estimation of the parameter setting for the computation nodes. The Eq. (7) estimates the optimal solution with the energy prediction for the 𝐶𝑁 in the reward estimates in the states 𝑆 and for the task 𝑇𝐽 .

7. Experimental methods and result

Consider a measurement of CA and its effectiveness is measured using the MEC data in the pattern of IoT support. The behavior analysis has been estimated with the pattern of user devices and the devices allocate the pattern of behavior data analysis. The task execution has been allocated with the delay is performed in the device and the communication resource in the caching does the handling capacity in the network [52]. The MEC has been upgraded in the CA requests in the base station in the parameter for the QoF supports the estimation. The data from different heterogeneous sources has been analyzed for estimating the [53]. The various path losses and link gain is predicted

with the above Table 1 with the path loss and Device to device (D2D) link estimation for the data transfer and generated is assumed to be of with the hit rate and non hit rate. Where the hit rate is assumed to be off
𝑝
∑ 𝐻𝑖𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝑋𝑖, 𝑗 × 100%
𝑖=1
The Hit rate is calculated with the estimation of request assembled in user 𝑗 with the time of 𝐼 and 𝑋 is assumed to be about the sum of services of the 𝑄 values. The D2D multiple resources have been accessed by the multiple cellular users and D2D users are collaborating with the resources in the coordination of the user communication devices. The resource sharing has been accessed with the throughput and performance has been monitored in the performance loss in D2D users. As observed in the D2D link gradually increases when the throughput increases, when the user increases the channel gain also increases in Fig. 7. The signal gain is associated with the increase in user ratio and the user may vary from 15 to 20, the performance measures increase gradually without delay in Fig. 8.
Besides the throughput has been compared using nodes up to 350 IoT nodes with the genetic algorithm and artificial bee colony algorithm and it is observed that the MOACO gives a significant performance as given in Table 2.
8. Conclusion
This paper investigates the key approach on examining the QoF mechanism that enables the dynamic resource allocation and an input table with the task allocation. The reinforcement learning and MOACO approach estimates the optimal solution in MEC with the IoT dataset. The factors affecting the delay and transmission power are predicted with mobile edge computing resources using the CA in D2D and the multicellular path. It assesses the performance in the neighboring user equipments. In this approach, the application is proposed with the cognitive agent supporting the resource optimization hence the paradigm is assumed to be that the mapping table helps the low cost values with the low state that makes the server communication and task allocation in an efficient manner. Besides the objective is task allocation with proper resource scheduling in that aspect the application is highlighted with the low cost mapping table for cognitive agent application. The
