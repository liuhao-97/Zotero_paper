ABSTRACT Ultra-dense network (UDN) is considered as a promising technology in 5G wireless networks. In an UDN network, dynamic trafﬁc patterns can lead to a high computational complexity and an excessive communications overhead with traditional resource allocation schemes. In this paper, a new resource allocation scheme presenting a low computational overhead and a low subband handoff rate in a dynamic ultra-dense heterogeneous network is presented. The scheme ﬁrst deﬁnes a new interference estimation method that constructs network interference state map, based on which a radio resource allocation scheme is proposed. The resource allocation problem is a MAX-K cut problem and can be solved through a graphtheoretical approach. System level simulations reveal that the proposed scheme decreases the subband handoff rate by 30% with less than 3.2% network throughput degradation.

I. INTRODUCTION The demand for ubiquitous availability of reliable and high data rate mobile services is ever increasing. Mobile data trafﬁc demand has been predicted to have a 1000-fold increase in the next 20 years [1], [2]. To meet the explosive capacity increase of mobile communication systems, Ultra-dense Networking (UDN) has been widely considered as a promising technology [3]. In addition, studies predict that more than 50% of voice calls and more than 70% of data trafﬁc in the future wireless networks originated from indoors [4]. Thus, indoor femtocells (FCs) will play a signiﬁcant role in the 5G network access, especially for low velocity or stationary users [5]. Ultra-dense deployed FCs overlaid with traditional macrocells (MCs) lead to a more advanced network, namely, Ultra-Dense Heterogeneous Network (UDHN).
With the enormous growth of mobile devices capacity and cloud computing, the latency of the communication, reliability of the services, and pervasive availability of the networks are among the most important performance metrics when deploying 5G UDHNs. According to the METIS project, there are mainly ﬁve features of 5G communication systems: 1) amazingly fast, 2) great service in a crowd, 3) ubiquitous

things communicating, 4) best experience follows you, and 5) super real-time and reliable connections [6]. In UDHNs, there are a number of technical challenges [7], among which one of the most important challenges is how to efﬁciently allocate and utilize subband resources to improve the spectrum efﬁciency and mitigate interference. Furthermore, in a dynamic UDHN, subband resource allocation should be rather stable and any subband handoff should be swift.
There have been extensive ongoing researches on subband resource allocation [8]–[10], which are mainly classiﬁed into centralized approaches and decentralized approaches. However, most of the existing schemes used in the traditional heterogeneous networks(HetNets) will not be suitable in the UDHN mainly due to two reasons. i) Existing decentralized approaches converge slowly due to a large number of nodes in the UDHN and thus real-time and reliable requirements of UDHN are difﬁcult to achieve. ii) Traditional centralized approaches can achieve optimal/near-optimal performance while the huge computational overhead stays as a concern. Thus an efﬁcient resource allocation scheme that provides rapid and stable resource allocation decisions for a dynamic UDHN is urgently needed.

C. Niu et al.: Fast and Efficient Radio Resource Allocation in Dynamic UDHNs

Lately extensive work have been done on dynamic interference mitigation in UDHNs. In [11]–[17], the authors worked on the resource allocation problem using a clustering based graph scheme. In [11], clustering based resource allocation scheme was investigated in a densely deployed femtocell network. In that paper, the resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program, and the proposed scheme can achieve near optimal performance with a reduced computational complexity. Anjum et al. [12] considered the real time interference and trafﬁc characteristics jointly in heavily overlapped femtocells by using a clustering scheme. In [13], a suboptimal subband assignment and interference management algorithm was designed based on an adaptive graph coloring approach and fractional frequency reuse scheme. [11]–[13] can achieve a good performance in controlling co-tier interference and cross-tier interference. However they are less effective in handling dynamic network conditions in an UDHN. In [14]–[17], dynamic network conditions were investigated. In [14], a dynamic graph based scheme was proposed to coordinate dynamic interference. In that scheme, a two tier clustering scheme is used to divide femtocells and UEs into several small groups. While the proposed scheme can achieve a near optimal performance, its potential high communication overhead is not evaluated. In [15], a multi-cluster based dynamic subband assignment method is discussed in UDNs. The scheme divides the entire spectrum into two groups, namely dynamic group and static group. Static UEs can get a stable transmit experience. But the spectrum partition actually lowers down the spectral efﬁciency. Further, the scheme presents a high computational complexity. Yoon et al. [16] proposed an interference weight calculation algorithm to reduce the computational complexity of the dynamic cell clustering scheme. The computational complexity can be reduced to half compared to the traditional clustering based scheme, but the feasibility of this algorithm in dynamic UDHNs is not discussed. In [17], an interferenceseparation clustering based scheme is used to lower down the communication overhead and computational complexity in dynamic UDHNs. In this scheme, massive small cells are divided into different small groups with different priorities to reduce the complexity. This scheme can achieve a real time resource allocation, while the spectral efﬁciency is low.
Subband handoff between different time slots has all been ignored in the above papers. Unnecessary subband handoff leads to a high latency, a high computation overhead, and a low reliability of the services. To tackle this problem, in this paper a new fast subband allocation scheme with low subband handoff rate is proposed based on the graph clustering theory. Further, a more ﬂexible UFR approach is used to offer a higher spectral efﬁciency in this paper. The proposed scheme ﬁrst presents the system model and proposes a potential interference estimation method between different users in HetNets, including intra-tier and inter-tier interference estimation. A network Interference State Map (ISM) is constructed to compare the network state information between different subband allocation time slots (TSs). Afterwards,
1912

an advanced cluster-based subband allocation algorithm in a universal spectrum reuse scheme is discussed and a fast subband allocation scheme (FAS) based on the ISM and subband allocation algorithm is presented.
The main contributions of this paper are summarized in the following. First, a new fast subband allocation scheme with a low subband handoff rate is developed. Second, a new interference evaluation model in two-tier ultra-dense deployed heterogeneous networks is deﬁned. Third, a new ISM model is proposed to represent the interference in HetNets.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The system model is shown in Section II. In Section III, the fast subband allocation scheme is elaborated. Section IV evaluates the performance of the proposed scheme via simulations. Section V draws the conclusion of the paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION A. SYSTEM MODEL In a two-tier UHDN, an MBS with a coverage radius RM is located at the center with a number of FBSs densely deployed within the coverage of that MBS. Two different UEs are considered, namely MUEs served by the MBS and FUEs served by FBSs. Both MUEs and FUEs are uniformly distributed with respective densities as λm and λf [18]. FBSs constitute the femto-tier and the coverage area of each FBS is a circular region with a radius of Rf . In an UDHN, different FBSs can have overlapped coverage areas due to the high density of FBSs. So the actual service area of FBSs induces a Voronoi tessellation [19], as shown in Fig. 1.
FIGURE 1. The Voronoi Femtocell topology ( stands for an FBS).
In the considered UDN, time domain consists of time slots and the resource allocation decision is made every time slot. Further, in each time slot t, n(m,t) MUEs and n(f ,t) FUEs can join, leave or change their locations in the network. Each cell, either an MC or a FC, constitutes an independent agent that performs autonomous radio resource allocation decisions with the objective of improving UE signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) while guaranteeing UE quality of

service (QoS). All the system conﬁguration information is accessible at the MBS. These information can include geographic locations of MUEs, FBSs and FUEs, the channel fading parameters, and dynamic system information.

We assume the same K channels are used in all the cells, including one MBS

B. PROBLEM FORMULATION FUEs in the serving area of each FBS are allocated orthogonal resources from that FBS. Radio resources are allocated in the unit of subband and each UE is assumed to be assigned an equal number of subbands. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that one subband is allocated to each UE. The FAS scheme aims to construct a fast subband allocation while minimizes unnecessary subband handoff among UEs. UEs that stay in the same condition (including location, active/idle state) in two consecutive time slots are deﬁned as static users (U S ), which include static macro UEs (UMS ) and static femto UEs (UFS ). Also, UEs that join, leave or change their locations in two consecutive time slots are deﬁned as dynamic UEs (U D), including dynamic macro UEs (UMD ) and dynamic femto UEs (UFD). To save energy, FBSs serving no FUE are turned off and they will only receive system control information. If one off-FBS detects that there is any UE in its serving area, this off-FBS will be turned on. The turned-off FBSs are shown as white colored areas in Fig. 1. Only FBSs with active
1913

FUEs are allocated subbands. So the total number of FBSs keep the same but the number of active FBSs may change from time to time.

FIGURE 3. Network interference topology variation due to UE mobility.

Due to dynamics in the network, within two consecutive time slots, the network interference topology can change. Fig. 3.I is the network interference topology of red marked area as shown in Fig. 2, where circles stand for UEs, solid lines between different circles stand for co-channel interference, and different colors stand for different subbands. The corresponding interference matrix can be expressed as:

Comparing interference matrices (8) and (9), one can see that even though UEs A, C, D, and G change their respective locations, the interference relationship between different UEs still keep quite the same. Thus there is no need to change the original subband allocations among UEs. In a different

1914

scenario, as shown in Fig. 3.III, even though only UEs D and E change their locations, the entire network interference

relationship changes and the corresponding new interference matrix of III becomes:

From matrices (8) and (10), the network subbands need to
be re-allocated and we call this reallocation as subband hand-
off. The condition that triggers subband handoff is critical in
the FAS scheme. As such, subband handoff indicator (SSI) is deﬁned to represent the subband handoff. We have SSIut = 0 when the following conditions are met.

suk,t = sku ,t−1;

suk,t = 1,

∀k, k ∈ K , u ∈ U ;

(11)

k = k .

Otherwise, SSIut = 1. suk,t (sku ,t−1) is the subband allocation indicator. U = M ∪ JF is the set of all UEs in the coverage
area of MBS.

The objective of the proposed scheme is to minimize the

subband handoff frequency (SHF). The optimization problem

is formulated as:

min( t∈T SSIut ), ∀u ∈ U ,

(12)

|T |

where T is the set of time slots.

III. PROPOSED SOLUTION A. INTERFERENCE ESTIMATION
In the FAS scheme, the subband resource allocation can be decided based on the interference matrix. In UDHNs, network interference topology can be much more complicated than what is shown in Fig. 3.
To further evaluate the total potential inﬂuence a UE causes to the entire network when it uses a speciﬁc subband, Accumulate Regional Average Interference Strength (AAS) is deﬁned. We use the coverage area as the evaluating area of one FBS. The calculation method of AAS varies between MUE and FUE. This paper follows the interference evaluation method deﬁned in [21] with some changes.

1) FUEs AAS The total potential inﬂuence that a FUE causes to the entire network in an UDN is deﬁned in the same way in [21], which is summarized in the following.

2) MUEs AAS When an MUE uses a speciﬁc subband, the potential inﬂuence it causes to other MUEs needs to be evaluated. The AAS from an MUE to other UEs is the AAS from MBS to all the other MUEs and FBSs in the coverage of this MBS. Here these two interference scenarios are discussed separately.

B. NETWORK INTERFERENCE STATE MAP

In this section we discuss the network interference state

map (ISM) construction process. The ISM covers an area of √
2∗RM ∗ 3RM with ∗0.866∗ pixels, where the length of

one pixel ψ is the minimum distance between two different

users,

=

2RM ψ

.

The

MBS

locates

at

the

center

of

the

ISM

with a coordinate (0, 0). The coverage area of the MBS is

divided into three sectors, sector.0, sector.1 and sector.3. We

set the value of the pixels located outside the hexagonal MBS

coverage area as 0. The interference map includes two layers,

MUE layer and FBS layer, which are discussed separately in

the following.

VOLUME 5, 2017

1) ISM PIXEL WEIGHT FOR MUE LAYER
We ﬁrst calculate the average interference weight hm(i, j) on ISM pixel with coordinate (i, j). Without loss of generality, sector.0 is used as the tagged sector for study.

IMAAS =

ImAAS .

(19)

m∈MS0

hm(i, j)

=

IMAAS 3 (2n − 1) nk

.
1 n=1 2n−1

(20)

MS0 stands for the set of MUEs located at sector 0; nk is the total number of pixels whose distance d from the center point satisﬁes (n − 1) ψ < d ≤ nψ and d2 = i2 + j2. The calculation of hn is detailed in Appendix. A. Thus ISM of MUE layer can be constructed in Fig. 4. The ISM of MBS
tier changes from sector to sector. Within each sector, as long
as the number and locations of MUEs keep unchanged, the
ISM for that sector stays the same.

FIGURE 4. ISM for MUE layer.

2) ISM PIXEL WEIGHT FOR FBS LAYER
In an UDHN, the locations of FBSs in reality do not change quite often. However, the active/idle state of each FBS can vary from time to time. As each FBS has a Voronoi serving area, the average interference weight hf (i, j) contributed by FBS f to the ISM pixel in the coverage area of FBS f is:

hf (i, j)

=

tf IfAAS , nf

(21)

nf

=

Sf ψ2

.

(22)

tf is the FBS activation state indicator, i.e. tf = 1 if FBS f is active (i.e., there are active FUEs in the serving area of FBS f ), while tf = 0 otherwise. nf is the total number of pixels in the coverage area of FBS f . Sf is the total coverage area of FBS f . So the ISM of FBS layer can be constructed in Fig. 5.

1915

FIGURE 5. ISM for FBS layer.

FIGURE 6. ISM.

When combining the ISM maps from MBS and FBS layers one can get the ISM of the entire network, as shown in Fig. 6.

ISM (i, j) = hm(i, j) + hf (i, j).

(23)

C. ISM SIMILARITY CALCULATION In the FAS scheme, similarity among ISMs in two consecutive time slots needs to be evaluated. Structural Similarity (SSIM) has been proposed in [22] and [23] for that purpose. Assume SSIM is calculated between t0 and t1.

dmin,m and the distance between two nearest FBSs is Rmin,f . It is assumed that dmin,m = Rmin,f . The calculation of ISMmax is provided in Appendix. B.

D. ADVANCED CLUSTER-BASED SUBBAND ALLOCATION ALGORITHM(ASA)
The cluster-based subband allocation scheme has been discussed in [21]. Based on the T-HCDA algorithm proposed in [21], in this paper we propose an advanced subband allocation algorithm that can better address dynamic conditions in an UDN. In this scheme, the MBS makes the allocation decision, including the interference graph G(V , E) construction and subband resource allocation. The vertex set V includes all the FBSs and all the MUEs, edge set E stands for the interference relationship between different vertexes. KG is the weight matrix to characterize the potential interference between two vertexes. The calculation of KG is the same as in [21].
Upon the construction of interference graph, the subband allocation problem becomes a cluster based graph MAX-K cut problem, in which UEs in the same cluster can share

VOLUME 5, 2017

C. Niu et al.: Fast and Efficient Radio Resource Allocation in Dynamic UDHNs

the same subband. Assume that the number of subbands is K = |K | and the weight between node i and node j is kgij. An advanced cluster-based subband allocation algorithm (ASA) is proposed to control the subband allocation process.
In the ASA algorithm, the nodes are partitioned into K disjoint sets D = D1 ∪ D2 ∪ ... ∪ DK that maximize the weights between the disjoint sets in G = (V , E). We ﬁrst assign every node a certain interference weight label, where the weight label of every node is:

LV = {lv|lv = IvAAS , v ∈ V }.

(34)

In the following process of ASA, there are two conditions:
• The initial cluster set D is empty. We name this condition as original subband allocation circulation (OSAC). OSAC consists of two steps. In Step one, we ﬁrst choose K nodes with the smallest label as the cluster of K clusters. In Step two, the rest nodes are assigned to the clusters one by one by following an ascending label sequence. Only when the following constraints are satisﬁed can node v be assigned to cluster k:

K Gk ≤ KGa,

∀a ∈ K ; (35)

KGk = u∈Dk kgvu.

• The initial cluster set D is not empty. We name this condition as a halfway subband allocation circulation (HSAC). In the HSAC, the nodes that remain in the cluster set D will be assigned to the original cluster that they stay in the last subband allocation time slot. That means these nodes will not switch their subbands. After that, the rest nodes that are not in D are assigned to the clusters by following Step two of OSAC.

The pseudo-codes of the ASA algorithm are listed in Algorithm 1.

E. FAST SUBBAND ALLOCATION SCHEME We further propose a new Fast Subband Allocation (FAS) scheme. It is assumed that the MBS will make the resource allocation decisions and the MBS stores all the allocation results. At each time slot, the FAS scheme consists of three steps:

1) STEP 1: ISM CONSTRUCTION
In this step the MBS ﬁrst constructs the ISM, deﬁned as ISM 1, of the entire network, according to the method in
subsection.B. The ISM constructed in the previous time slot is deﬁned as ISM 0.

2) STEP 2: ISM MATCHING If ISM 0 = ∅, go to Step 3 directly. Otherwise calculate SSIM S(0,1) of ISM 1 and ISM 0. Compare the SSIM value with the ISM Similarity Factor threshold Sth.
• If S(0,1) ≥ Sth, D0 is updated to D by keeping static UEs in D0 and remove dynamic UEs from D0.
• If S(0,1) < Sth, D is set to empty.

3) STEP 3: SUBBAND ALLOCATION
MBS assigns each UE to a cluster according to the ASA algorithm and cluster set D1 is formed. The corresponding variables are updated in the following.
• If S(0,1) ≥ Sth, both D0 and ISM 0 remain unchanged. • If S(0,1) < Sth, update D0 and ISM 0 with D1 and ISM 1
respectively.

The corresponding algorithm ﬂowchart of FAS scheme

is presented in Fig.7. The computational complexity of this

scheme consists of three parts. The ﬁrst part comes from the

potential interference estimation, which has a computation

complexity O((N D)2), N D = |UMD ∪ UFD|. The second part comes from ISM construction, which has a computational

complexity O( 2) and is only a function of the network size.

The third part comes from the subband allocation, which

has

a

complexity

of

O(

)(N 2

)

≈

O((N D)2).

Thus the total computational complexity of the FAS scheme

is O((N D)2).

Since the cluster-based resource allocation is a roll polling

algorithm, in every polling circle, one UE is allocated to

a cluster. After N polling circles, the algorithm reaches

convergence. In this paper, we propose the FSA algorithm,

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

In this section, the performance of the proposed FAS scheme

is evaluated via simulation. The simulation parameters are

listed in Table 1 by following 3GPP LTE speciﬁcations [24].

A 19 cell 57 sector cell conﬁguration is used in the simu-

lation. For a better accuracy on interference evaluation, sim-

ulation results are only collected from the center 7 cells [25].

MUEs are randomly distributed over the MC areas and FUEs

are randomly distributed in the coverage area of FCs, both fol-

lowing PPP. The path loss model is introduced in Table 2 [26]

and the fading follows a Rayleigh distribution. The path-loss

from the BS (MBS or FBS) to an UE (MUE or FUE) depends

on whether that UE is indoor or outdoor, which is captured

by the indicator function. δ = 1 is for indoor and δ = 0 is

for outdoor. And in the following simulations, we deﬁne the

dynamic

UE rate

as: η

n(m,t ) +n(f |M |+|JF

)

.

The performance of FAS scheme is compared with three other schemes, namely optimal heterogeneous cluster-based greedy scheme (OHCIG), interference-separation clusteringbased scheme (ISC) [17], and multi-cluster based dynamic subband assignment (MC-DCA) [15]. As mentioned in Section III, the total computational complexity of the FAS scheme is O((N D)2). OHCIG scheme is a common polling process. In every polling circle, N UEs join the polling process. So the computational complexity of OHCIG is O((N )2). Further, the computational complexity of ISC has been proved by the authors [17], which is O((N )2). The total computational complexity of MC-DCA scheme, which is also a common roll polling algorithm, is O((N )2) [15].
Fig. 8 shows the a Monte-Carlo experiment results of optimal ISM Similarity Factor threshold Sth for the FAS algorithm, where MU stands for all MUEs, FU stands for all FUEs, MMU stands for dynamic MUEs, and MFU stands for dynamic FUEs. As shown in Fig. 8.(a), when Sth increases, the average throughput of MUEs increases slowly and reaches a peak when Sth = 0.6. The average throughput of MMUs increases with the increase of Sth and achieves the biggest value when Sth = 0.8. Further, one can see

from Fig. 8.(b) that the average throughput of FUEs can reach two peaks at Sth = 0.6 and Sth = 0.8, respectively. Fig. 8.(c) shows the subband handoff time (NHT) of each UE averaged over 100 TSs. As Sth increases, NHT increases

sharply and the value is 22.30 when Sth = 0.9, which means on average a UE needs to switch its subband usage every 4 TSs. By taking both the average UE throughput and NHT into considerations, Sth = 0.6 is selected in the following simulation results.
Fig. 9 shows the average subband handoff frequency as a function of dynamic UE rates. Fig. 10 presents the average throughput of UEs with different dynamic UE rate. There are two constraints that can affect the average subband handoff frequency, the subband re-allocation in HMI and the number of static UEs in the entire network. Generally, as the increase of Dynamic UE rate, the static UE rate decreases. Since the average subband handoff frequency is a parameter that indicates the unnecessary subband switch frequency of static UEs, the value decreases with the increase of dynamic UE rate, which is also proved in Fig. 9. Further, we can see there is a peak when dynamic UE rate is 0.25. That is because when the ratio of dynamic UEs is relatively low, the subband re-allocation in HMI has a major inﬂuence on the performance of average subband handoff frequency. Though the re-allocation is not frequent, the inﬂuence is apparent, so there is an increase trend when dynamic UE rate is smaller

FIGURE 13. Average Subband Handoff frequency vs. FUE density.
than 0.3. Also, we can see that when the dynamic UE ratio varies, the performance of FAS scheme is better than the other three schemes. When the dynamic UE rate is 0.4, the average subband handoff frequency of FAS is 0.32, which is only 70% of the OHCIG scheme. And at the same time,

FIGURE 14. Average throughput of UE with different FUE density. (a) Average MUE throughput. (b) Average FUE throughput. (c) Average dynamic MUE throughput. (d) Average dynamic FUE throughput.

as shown in Fig. 10(a), the average MUE throughput of FAS scheme is only 0.75% worse than that of the OHCIG scheme and the average FUE throughput of FAS scheme is only 0.5% worse than that of the HCIG scheme. When it comes to the dynamic UEs, the biggest gap of average UE throughput between the FAS scheme and the OHCIG scheme appears when the dynamic UE rate is 0.4, which is 2% for MMUE and 0.5% for MFUE respectively.
Fig. 11 shows the average subband handoff frequency with different MUE densities. Fig. 12 shows the average UE throughput with different MUE Densities. From Fig. 11 we can see that, when the MUE density changes, the subband handoff restriction performance of the FAS scheme outperforms the other three schemes. When the MUE density is 6 ∗ 10−4 per m2, the subband handoff frequency of the FAS scheme is 0.33 per TS, which is 30% better than the OHCIG scheme, 19.5% better than ISC scheme and 42% better than the DCA scheme. As a marginal trade-off of this performance gain, as shown in Fig. 12, FAS has 0.2% MUE throughput decrease and 0.23% FUE throughput decrease compared with the OHCIG scheme. Dynamic MUE throughput shows the

biggest difference among different schemes. There is an average 1.4% decrease in dynamic MUE throughput in the FAS scheme compared with the OHCIG scheme. When compared with the other two schemes, ISC scheme and DCA scheme, the FAS scheme presents an overall performance advantage on all categories.
Fig. 13 shows the average subband handoff frequency with different FUE densities. Fig. 14 shows the average throughput of UEs with different FUE Densities. From Fig. 13 we can see that, when the FUE density increases, the subband handoff frequency of all the schemes deteriorates. When more FUEs are located in the area under study, the more dynamics can occur in that area, which leads to a more frequent subband reallocation. In general, the FAS scheme outperforms the other three schemes. When the FUE density is 1.4 ∗ 10−3 per m2, the subband handoff frequency of FAS scheme is 0.325 per time slot, while the OHCIG scheme shows a value of 0.48 per time slot. The trade-off of this 32.3% improvement is 3.2% MUE average throughput degradation and 0.7% FUE average throughput degradation for FAS. When compared with the other two schemes, the FAS scheme has a lower MUE average

throughput performance than the DCA scheme but shows better performance on other categories.

V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a fast subband allocation scheme is proposed to mitigate interference in an ultra dense dynamic heterogeneous network using cluster-based graph theory. In the existing interference mitigation schemes, UEs are normally assigned different subbands in different time slots, which leads to a high subband handoff rate and a high computational complexity. In this paper, a new subband allocation scheme allows static UEs to keep their allocated subbands when the network interference state meets certain conditions. Further, the proposed scheme is more efﬁcient and offers a higher spectral efﬁciency than other frequency reuse schemes. The proposed FAS has a computational complexity O((N D)2) and achieves almost the same spectral efﬁciency compared with the traditional UFR scheme, whose computational complexity O(N 2) is much higher. The system level simulation show that the FAS has advantageous performance on subband handoff rate and latency while a reasonable trade-off on UE throughput is noted.
