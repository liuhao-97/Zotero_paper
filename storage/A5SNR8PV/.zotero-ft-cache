Title EU Code of Conduct on Energy Consumption of Broadband Equipment Version 6
Abstract Expectations are that broadband equipment will contribute considerably to the electricity consumption of households in European Community in the near future. Depending on the penetration level, the specifications of the equipment and the requirements of the service provider, a total European consumption of at least 50 TWh per year was estimated for the year 2015 for broadband equipment. With the general principles and actions resulting from the implementation of the Code of Conduct the electricity consumption can be slightly reduced or kept constant compared to a business as usual scenario with growing usage and penetration of broadband equipment in the EU.
The Code of Conduct sets out the power consumption levels for energy efficient broadband equipment.

INTRODUCTION
Expectations are that broadband equipment will contribute considerably to the electricity consumption of households in European Community in the near future. Depending on the penetration level, the specifications of the equipment and the requirements of the service provider, a total European consumption of at least 50 TWh per year was estimated for the year 2015 for broadband equipment. With the general principles and actions resulting from the implementation of this Code of Conduct the (maximum) electricity consumption could be slightly reduced or kept constant compared to a business as usual scenario with growing usage and penetration of broadband equipment in the EU..1
The potential new electrical load represented by this equipment needs to be addressed by EU energy and environmental policies. It is important that the electrical efficiency of broadband equipment is maximised.
To help all parties to address the issue of energy efficiency whilst avoiding competitive pressures to raise energy consumption of equipment all service providers, network operators, equipment and component manufacturers are invited to sign this Code of Conduct.
This Code of Conduct sets out the basic principles to be followed by all parties involved in broadband equipment, operating in the European Community, in respect of energy efficient equipment.

1 The article by Ward Van Heddeghem, Sofie Lambert, Bart Lannoo, Didier Colle, Mario Pickavet, Piet Demeester, "Trends in worldwide ICT electricity consumption from 2007 to 2012" [30], estimated a global consumption of communication networks in 2012 of 334 TWh. As the EU total electricity consumption is 14.3% of global energy consumption, by adopting this proportion the EU consumption of communication networks in 2012 is estimated to 47 TWh. This is a conservative estimate as the ICT consumption in the EU is representing a large share of total electricity consumption compared to other regions.

EQUIPMENT COVERED

This Code of Conduct covers equipment for broadband services both on the customer side as listed in Table 1, and on the network side as listed in Table 2. Note that not all the equipment listed in these tables may yet have a complete set of associated power targets. Any such missing values may be added to future versions of the Code of Conduct, as may any additional technologies that become significant in the Broadband space. Figure 1 below gives examples of home gateway/modem configurations with the boundary between customer premises and network equipment that this Code of Conduct takes into account. This Code of Conduct covers also the equipment for Small Office Home Office (SOHO) applications. Terminals like PCs or TVs are not covered by this Code of Conduct.

Figure 1: Examples of configurations
Broadband access equipment is defined by its incorporation of a transmission technology capable of providing more than 2048 kbit/s (ITU-T Rec I.113 [1]) full-rate capacity in at least one direction.
When equipment is in an idle state, it needs to be able to provide services with the same quality as in the on-state, or to be able transition to the on-state to deliver the service without introducing a significant additional delay from the user perspective. This requirement holds regardless of whether the service is initiated from the WAN-side, or the LAN-side.
In this Code of Conduct these categories of equipment will subsequently be referred to as “customer premises equipment” (CPE) and “network equipment” or “broadband equipment” in general.
Table 1: CPE covered

Type of CPE
Home gateways: • DSL CPEs (ADSL, ADSL2, ADSL2plus, VDSL2, VDSL2 with G.993.5 (Vectoring) support) and G.fast • DOCSIS Cable CPEs • Optical CPEs (PON and PtP) • Ethernet router CPEs

Broadband Equipment Code of Conduct – Version 6.0 5

COMMITMENT

Signatories of this Code of Conduct agree to make all reasonable efforts to:

a) Abide by the General Principles contained in Annex A.

b) Achieve the power consumption targets set out in Annex C, for at least 90% (by number2) of the new-model of broadband equipment in each category (Section C.1.1 to C.1.4 and 0 to C.2.5) covered by this Code of Conduct that are introduced to the market after the indicated dates. For an equipment vendor, “new-model” means equipment that is first placed on the market3 during a given year (note that a simple production optimisation or bug-fix would not necessarily constitute a new-model). For a network operator, "new-model" means equipment of a particular type and specification being procured for the first time in a given year. For the subsequent manufacture or purchase/installation of the same equipment, the Code of Conduct values pertaining to the original year of introduction/purchase apply. To take into account the time network operators need to select new equipment and introduce it into their networks, network operators are entitled to specify the Tier of the Code of Conduct that applied at the date on which the operator formally initiated the procurement process for this equipment (e.g. the date on which the Invitation to Tender for that equipment was issued). If this approach is employed, the operator shall formally notify the supplier of the relevant date and Tier.

c) Provide end-users with information about power consumption of CPE (CPE-on-state, CPE-idle-state) and about switching off CPE in the user manual, on the Internet, the packaging, and/or at the point of sales.

d) Co-operate with the European Commission and Member State authorities in an annual review of the scope of the Code of Conduct and the power consumption targets for future years.

e) Co-operate with the European Commission and Member States in monitoring the effectiveness of this Code of Conduct through the reporting form that is available on the homepage of the EU Standby Initiative [3].

f) Ensure that procurement specifications for broadband equipment are compliant with this Code of Conduct.

Each version of the Code of Conduct, once published, is a standalone document that supersedes all previous versions, and neither refers to nor depends on such versions. When a new version of the Code of Conduct comes into force, it is assumed that

2 For CPE, ‘by number’ means ’by number of units placed on the market’. For network equipment ’by number’ means ‘by number of ports placed on the market’, so as to allow for equipment with very different numbers of ports.
3 "A product is placed on the market when it is made available for the first time on the Union market." [31]

Broadband Equipment Code of Conduct – Version 6.0 7

companies/organizations who have already signed the Code of Conduct will remain signatories for the new version. However any company/organization may withdraw its signature from the Code of Conduct with no penalty.

4.

MONITORING

Signatories agree to provide information on the power consumption of their equipment which is covered by the Code of Conduct to the European Commission on annual basis. This should be provided by the end of each March for the previous calendar year. Where a signatory first signs part way through a calendar year, then reporting for that first year should be done from the date of signing, not the beginning of that calendar year.

The anonymous results will be discussed at least once a year by the signatories, the European Commission, Member States, and their representatives in order to:

a) Evaluate the level of compliance and the effectiveness of this Code of Conduct in achieving its aims.

b) Evaluate current and future developments that influence energy consumption, (i.e., Integrated Circuit development, etc.) with a view to agreeing actions and/or amendments to the Code of Conduct.

c) Set targets for future time periods.

5.

REPORTING

The presentation of the results provided to the Commission will be in the form of the reporting sheet available on the homepage of the EU Standby Initiative [3].

Broadband Equipment Code of Conduct – Version 6.0 8

February 10th 2017

A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Signatories of this Code of Conduct should endeavour to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that:

A.1 For broadband equipment in general

A.1.1 Broadband equipment should be designed to meet the Code of Conduct power consumption targets. However, power management must not unduly impact the user experience, disturb the network, or contravene the applicable standards.

A.1.2

Operational and control systems are specified under the assumption that hardware has power management built in, where applicable, i.e., depending on the functionality required of the unit, the hardware will automatically switch to the state with the lowest possible power consumption.

A.1.3 Signatories will endeavour to assist in the improvement of the existing low-power standards, and the development of new ones as appropriate.4

A.2 For CPE

A.2.1 Any external power supplies used for CPE shall be in accordance with the EU Code of Conduct for External Power Supplies [4]. Power consumption of the external power supply shall be included in the power measurement.

A.2.2 CPE shall be designed under the assumption that the equipment may be physically disconnected from the mains or switched off manually by the customer, from time to time, at their own discretion.

A.2.3

Power delivered to other external equipment (e.g., over USB, PoE or to a reversed powered G.fast DPU port) shall not be included in the power consumption assessment of a CPE. This other equipment shall be disconnected for the power consumption measurement, except when this is in contradiction with the operation of the product. However, target values are specified for some specific USB devices, as a reference for USB manufacturers, and to be considered separately from the evaluation of the power budget (and related consumption objectives) of the CPEs they can be connected to.

A.3 For network equipment

A.3.1

Broadband network equipment should be designed to fulfil the environmental specifications of Class 3.1 for indoor use according to the ETSI Standard EN 300019-1-3 [5], and where appropriate the more extended environmental conditions than Class 3.1 for use at outdoor sites. At remote sites the outdoor cabinet including the Broadband network equipment shall fulfil Class 4.1 according to the ETSI Standard EN 300019-1-4 [6]. Broadband network equipment in the outdoor cabinet should be designed taking in account the characteristics of the cabinet and the outdoor environmental condition; e.g., in case of free cooling cabinet it should be considered that the equipment inside the cabinet could operate (for short time

4 For WAN-side DSL systems, this function can be activated (with care) for deployed ADSL2/2plus (see BBF TR-202 guidelines).

periods) at temperature up to 60° C. If cooling is necessary, it should be preferably cooled with fresh air (fan driven, no refrigeration). The Coefficient of Performance of new site cooling systems, defined as the ratio of the effective required cooling power to the energy needed for the cooling system, should be higher than 10.

DEFINITION OF OPERATION STATES

B.1 Definitions of CPE operation states

B.1.1 Off-state

In the off-state, the device is not providing any functionality. This state is defined by EC No 1275/2008 [9].

B.1.2 Idle-state

In the idle-state, the device is idle, with all the components being in their individual idle states. In this state the device is not processing or transmitting a significant amount of traffic, but is ready to detect activity.

Transitions between the idle-state and on-state must occur without manual reconfiguration of the device, i.e., they must happen automatically.

The definition of idle state for LAN Ethernet Ports of the Home Gateway in Table 3 is different from the definition of the idle state for LAN Ethernet Ports of simple broadband access devices (modems and NTs) in Table 4. For a Home Gateway, no LAN Ethernet port is connected for Idle-state testing. For a simple broadband access device (modems and NTs), one LAN Ethernet port is connected with link up, ready to pass traffic. The difference is due to the fact that the LAN Ethernet port of a modem is required to be operational at all times, while this is not necessarily the case for a Home Gateway.

The idle-state of a home gateway is defined as all the components of the home gateway being in their idle-state as defined in Table 3.

Table 3: Definition of the idle-state for home gateways

Port / component Central functions (processor and memory: routing, firewall, OAM (e.g., TR-069), user interface)

Idle-state
Not processing user traffic.
Single WAN: Idle (link established and up, the interface is ready to transmit traffic but no user traffic is present. More details on the physical layer configuration of certain interfaces can be found in the on-state definitions (see Table 7). The idle state configuration can be different than in on-state if this does not require a manual reconfiguration by the end user (e.g., in case of DOCSIS 3.0, the CPE transitions to a 1x1 configuration, in case of ADSL2plus transition to the L2 mode, or in case of G.fast transition to the discontinuous operation

interval).
In case of dual WAN interface5, for backup or alternative purposes, only one of the two ports will be in the Idle-state described above for a Single WAN, while the second will be disconnected or not active, but able to be manually or automatically activated if needed.
In case of dual WAN interface for simultaneous operation, both ports will be in the Idle-state described above for a Single WAN.

LAN Ethernet ports

Ports not connected (or no Ethernet link) but with Ethernet link detection active.

Wi-Fi

Beacon on, but no user traffic transmitted, no client associated.

Alternative LAN technologies (e.g. HPNA, MoCA, Powerline, POF)

MoCA, Powerline, HPNA, or POF capability is activated, but no user traffic transmitted.

1 FXS port with phone connected (200 Ohm / 5m max cable length), phone on-hook, off hook detection active. FXS Remaining FXS ports: no phone or other load connected, but able to detect a connection.

ISDN S0

1 phone connected (5m max cable length), the phone is powered locally by its own power supply (i.e., it is not powered via the S0 interface), phone on-hook, off hook detection active.
Remaining ISDN S0 ports: no phone or other load connected, but able to detect a connection.

FXO

No active call, incoming call detection enabled.

DECT interface

No active call, incoming call detection enabled.

DECT charging station for DECT handset

DECT handset on cradle, in trickle charge.

Backup battery

Battery is fully charged (trickle charging).

USB

No devices connected, detection of USB devices active.

When activity is detected on a component, the appropriate components transition to the onstate. The transition time should be less than 1 second wherever possible in order to not adversely impact the customer experience. The detection of the Ethernet link may take more than 1 second, but must stay below 3 seconds. This longer transition time can be tolerated in this case because it requires some user interaction to bring up the link (e.g., connect a device or boot a PC).

5 It should be noted that CPEs may exist with more than two WAN interfaces (e.g. in case of DSL bonding over more than two copper pairs). In the remainder of this document dual WAN interface CPEs are mentioned as the most common category of multi-WAN CPEs.

Broadband Equipment Code of Conduct – Version 6.0 12

February 10th 2017

Note that because only those components required to support the activated service go into their on-state, for a complete device (as opposed to a functional component) there will in fact be a range of power states. At any given time, the CPE should consume the minimum power commensurate with its current level of activity (with the appropriate hysteresis).

Idle-state
Idle (link established and up, the interface is ready to transmit traffic but no user traffic is present).
In idle state the LAN port is up and a link is physically and logically established (cable length is 10m as defined in ETSI EN 301575). There is no user traffic transmission on the link only, some insignificant handshake traffic is allowed.

Port / component Ethernet port

Idle-state
1 port in idle state (see LAN port in Table 4), in case of more than 1 port the remaining ports are disconnected but with Ethernet link detection active.

Port / component Ethernet port VoIP/telephony

Idle-state
1 port in idle state (see LAN port in Table 4), in case of more than 1 port the remaining ports are disconnected but with Ethernet link detection active.
No active call, call detection active, inactive display.

B.1.3 On-state
The on-state of a home gateway is defined as all the components of the home gateway being in their on-state as defined in Table 7.
For the interfaces carrying user traffic the minimal throughput that needs to be considered is indicated as well in Table 7. As this is the minimal traffic load to be applied to a certain interface, some interfaces can carry more traffic in order to accommodate all minimal traffic loads. This excess traffic should be carried on Ethernet LAN port(s).
Customer-side Ethernet ports present on CPEs are responsible of non-negligible energy consumption. Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) as defined in IEEE Std 802.3-2012 SECTION SIX [11] defines power saving mechanisms for wired, customer-side Ethernet ports (see also Annex G). It is then required that copper Ethernet (IEEE 802.3 [11]) interfaces in the CPE comply with EEE and requires that such function be activated. , During testing, the measurement equipment connected to EEE capable ports must also support EEE [11].
Transitions between the idle-state and on-state must occur without manual reconfiguration of the device, i.e., they must happen automatically.

B.2 Definitions of network operation states
For Broadband-Network-technologies the following states are differentiated:
• Network (e.g., DSL)-stand-by state: This state has the largest power reduction capability and there is no transmission of data possible. It is essential for this state that the device has the capability to respond to an activation request, leading to a direct state change. E.g., a transition to the network-full-load state may happen if data has to be transmitted from either side.
• Network (e.g., DSL)-low-load state: This state allows a limited power reduction capability and a limited data transmission is allowed. It is entered automatically from the network-full-load state after the data transmission during a certain time is lower than a predefined limit. If more than the limited data has to be transmitted from either side, a state change to the network-full-load state is entered automatically. The network-low-load state may comprise multiple sub-states with history dependent statetransition rules.
• Network (e.g., DSL)-full-load state: This is the state in which a maximal allowed data transmission is possible. The maximum is defined by the physical properties of the line and the settings of the operator.
• For the wireless network equipment also the following states are defined:
o Busy hour-load-state
o Medium-load-state
o Low-load-state

POWER LEVELS: TARGETS AND TIME SCHEDULE

C.1 CPE

CPEs covered by this Code of Conduct (home gateways, home network infrastructure devices and other home network devices) should meet the following maximum power consumption targets in the on-state and in the idle-state as defined in section B.1. In the off-state, these CPEs must meet the requirements of the Code of Conduct for External Power Supplies [4].

The CPEs should apply all possible energy saving actions, minimizing the overall power consumption whenever possible (e.g., when all or some of its functions are not operating).

The power levels defined in this document for all states are mean values based on sufficiently long measurement periods (at least 5 minutes), during which the equipment remains continuously in that same state (measurements should only start when the equipment is stable in this state for at least 60 seconds). Power is measured at the 230V AC input.

C.1.1 Home Gateways
The home gateway6 is composed of several components, namely a processor plus memory, a WAN interface and several LAN interfaces. Depending on the purpose of a given home gateway, different components may be included. The power consumption targets for each type of home gateway are calculated by summing the values of its individual components. The home gateway as a whole has to meet the summed targets for its various modes of operation and activity. Component power consumption values are used to compute the overall home gateway target for a given configuration and mode of operation, but are not themselves normative.

The home gateway must meet the power targets for idle-state and for on-state as defined in section B.1. Depending on the actual state of the individual components, several intermediate power consumption levels for the home gateway exist.

The values per component for the idle-state and the on-state are given in the following tables.

If an interface is able to work in different modes it must establish a link with the highest possible capability and the targets have to be chosen accordingly. This for example applies to VDSL2, Wi-Fi 802.11n interfaces or Gigabit Ethernet LAN ports. I.e., for a Gigabit Ethernet interface, a Gigabit Ethernet capable device must be connected for measurement purposes and the Gigabit Ethernet target applies. The targets are defined taking into account that certain interfaces may have this capability of falling back from a higher capability to a lower one. If a lower capability device is connected, the power consumption should be lower and ideally reach the target of this lower capability technology, i.e., if a Fast Ethernet device is connected to a Gigabit Ethernet LAN port. Measurements in such lower capability configuration are not to be reported.

In cases where an interface is a removable module (e.g. Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP) devices), vendors providing a CPE but no removable module must test the CPE without the module and report results, while vendors providing a CPE with removable modules and operators must test with the removable module present and with the allowances associated with it. If different types of modules are to be used by a single product, each type must meet

6 A home gateway is used here as a generic term which encompasses all kinds of access interfaces (e.g. DSL, cable, fibre, etc.)

Broadband Equipment Code of Conduct – Version 6.0 19

February 10th 2017

the allocated budget but only the highest measurement is to be reported. Additional rules described below also apply in the case where the module is used in dual or backup WAN configurations.
In case of dual WAN, with reference to the definition of states, the calculation of targets for idle and on state will be performed on the basis of the following rules:
In case of dual WAN interface for backup or alternative purposes, the backup or alternative interface will be activated when the main interface loses connectivity. Additional allowances for the backup interfaces are found in Table 10a. Although only one WAN interface is active at any time, the calculation of the total budget must not take into account which interface is idle and which is active during testing and must be calculated only once. This total budget must be met under the below two conditions (and only the highest value for the Idle-State and the highest value for the On-state must be reported):
• The first one, corresponding to the situation when the main WAN interface is active and the backup or alternative interface is disconnected or not active
• The second one, corresponding to the situation when the backup is activated and the main interface is disconnected or not active
In case of dual WAN interface for simultaneous operation, additional allowances for the additional interfaces are found in Table 10b. The targets must be met under a test condition where both WAN interfaces are simultaneously connected and active in On mode.

Notes:

(10.1) The ONU values shown in Table 10 assume that the home gateway central functions include a Gigabit Ethernet switch functionality (the additional power budget for the PHY interface of the LAN ports will have to be accounted separately).

(10.2) The above consumption targets for all ONUs in Table 10 assume the use of optics that meet the PR-30 or PRX-30 power budgets (IEEE 802.3) or ITU-T G.984.2/G.987.2 [15] Class B/B+ power budgets, whichever is applicable.

(10.3) VDSL2 allowances include Home Gateways supporting G.993.5 (Vectoring).

(10.4)

The state of maturity of this technology is such that only indicative power targets can be set. Signatories must report the power consumptions values of any such equipment that they manufacture or deploy, so that the state of development of this technology can be taken into account when revising these targets in the future. Such reports will not be included in the assessment of whether or not the 90% target has been achieved.

There are types of home gateway device (e.g., a USB attached DSL modem or pure Layer 2 ONUs) that are so simple (e.g., only provide Layer 2 functionalities, does not contain an Ethernet switch, and has a single LAN interface) that it cannot be usefully decomposed into components. The power targets for such devices are given in Table 12.

(12.1) USB Modem Power consumption (W) is defined at the 5V USB Interface.

(12.2) The above consumption targets for all ONUs in Table 12 assume the use of optics that meet the PR-30 or PRX-30 power budgets (IEEE 802.3) or ITU-T G.984.2/G.987.2 Class B+ power budgets, whichever is applicable.

(12.3) If the ONU has a Fast Ethernet LAN port instead of a Gigabit Ethernet port the power targets are reduced by the difference between a Fast Ethernet LAN and a Gigabit Ethernet LAN port from Table 11.

(12.4)

The state of maturity of this technology is such that only indicative power targets can be set. Signatories must report the power consumptions values of any such equipment that they manufacture or deploy, so that the state of development of this technology can be taken into account when revising these targets in the future. Such reports will not be included in the assessment of whether or not the 90% target has been achieved.

C.1.2 USB dongles
For a home gateway with USB ports additional functionality originally not built into the device can also be provided via USB dongles. The power consumption of USB dongles is measured at the DC 5V USB interface.
For a home gateway with an internal USB device, the power budget shall include the value of the USB device defined in table 13 multiplied by a factor of (1/0.84) plus the USB value for the interface defined in table 11 (also see note 11.3).
Please note that the USB devices are considered as not equipped with additional chipsets implementing applications or complex software stacks that will drastically change the power values.

An HNID is typically a relatively simple device, where 1 Ethernet LAN port is already considered to be part of the initial configuration. Ethernet switches with 4 ports are considered to be part of the initial configuration. If an HNID has more than 4 Ethernet ports, additional allowances for those Ethernet ports can be added as defined in Table 11.
For more complex HNIDs, the same allowances for additional functionality apply as for home gateways (see Table 11). A function used for control or monitoring such as smart plugs, smart sensor and remote controllable light devices are considered equivalent to an HNID.

C.2 Network equipment
The following targets are power consumption targets per port.
a) All power values of the DSL network equipment in line with point 0 (except G.fast), C.2.2 and C.2.3 are measured at the power interface port interface as described in the standard ETSI EN 303 215 [16] or at the AC input, in case of directly mains powered systems. For directly mains powered systems, the power limits stated in Table 16 through Table 26 (except Table 16b, Table 17a and Table 18) are increased by 10%. In case of integrated remote or reverse powered systems, the power limits stated are increased by 15% for remote and 30% for reverse powered systems.
b) Power measurements of the G.fast equipment shall be performed on fully equipped, maximum configured DPUs (100% of activated ports). The power consumption numbers specified in Table 16b, Table 17a and Table 18 assume no extra allowance for <=128 lines and no extra allowance for vectoring. Depending on the different types of powering, the power limits specified in Table 16b, Table 17a and Table 18 should be increased by additional allowances defined in Table 16c.
c) For multi-profile boards, the power consumption limits do not apply to boards profile not optimized under energy efficiency point of view. Equipment makers shall specify what the optimized profile for the given board under test is at which the power consumption target limit apply. For instance, a board optimized for VDSL2 8b can support other profiles (e.g., 12a, 17a, 30a) but might have suboptimal performance at such additional profiles in terms of power consumption.
d) For boards which have additional functions (e.g., channel bonding) in addition to the bare DSL functionality, such boards are to be used in normal DSL mode of operation with any additional functions disabled. Optionally, a measurement with these functions enabled can be described/requested. If such additional functions cannot be fully disabled, manufacturers will declare what the extra power budget due to the added functionality is. Such an extra budget will not be considered in the per port power consumption computation.
e) In Table 16a, “vectored VDSL2” refers to a DSLAM that supports vectoring per ITUT G.993.5 on all its lines and operates with one or multiple vectored groups. Each line is included in one vectored group. The term “vectored group” is defined in ITU-T G.993.5. The DSLAM is configured for VDSL2 operation according to ETSI EN 303 215 [16] with upstream and downstream vectoring enabled on all its lines. For the configured profile, the DSLAM operates on all its lines at its maximum supported transmit power and over the widest frequency bands over which it supports vectoring. The DSLAM operates at its maximum cancellation capabilities in terms of number of cancelled disturbers and of SNR improvement gained with cancellation.

Therefore, Table 17 is applicable only to VDSL2 systems that support low power state. CO-MIB configuration parameters related to LPMode are defined in Table E.1 [21].

(17.2) Vectored VDSL2 targets are for further study.

(17.3) L2.1 low power state (with two sub-states: L2.1N and L2.1B) allows substantial reduction in power consumption and is primarily intended for support of VoIP, while other services are unused. L2.2 low power state is intended for keep-alive applications during multi-hour battery backup and it implements significant reduction of power consumption (resulting in extremely reduced data rate and loss of QoS).

DSL-standby-state corresponds to the L3-Idle state as defined in ITU-T Rec G.993. 2 [18]. G.fast-standby-state corresponds to the L3-Idle state as defined in ITU-T Rec G.9701 [23]. Stand-by targets do not apply to the Vectoring capable VDSL2 or Vectoring capable G.fast.

The above values for DSL-low-power and -standby-states are for fully equipped, maximum configuration DSLAMs with more than 128 ports. For equipment up to 128 ports (and with maximum configuration) 0.15W per line may be added to the above values for the whole DSLAM, with a minimum value of 5W.

The above G.fast values apply to fully equipped, maximum configuration DPUs within each category (single line, small, large or very large multiline). These numbers assume no extra allowance for <=128 lines and no extra allowance for vectoring.
To minimize cost, dimensions, and power consumption, the network equipment contains chips that control multiple DSL lines (4-8-16) each. If special care is not taken, a single line in DSL-full-load-state could result in a chip fully operational on the other lines also (in lowpower or standby states), resulting in an unnecessary waste of energy. The network systems (and their basic components) shall therefore be designed in order to tackle this issue, maximizing the energy savings also in mixed environments with lines in different power states, being this the typical situation found in the network.

MELT-stand-by state is defined as the state in which the Metallic Line Testing entity (MELT) is in IDLE mode, i.e., inactive, connected in parallel to the broadband port on the DSLAM and provisioned for line testing. MELT standby targets are additional allowances on top the power consumption targets defined for each of DSL operating states.

C.2.2 Combined DSL/Narrowband network equipment
Power consumption limits for POTS interface implementation into an MSAN are defined in Table 19. The values defined apply to a testing condition where the line length equivalent resistance (including the CPE resistance) is assumed to be 510 Ohm.
It is further assumed that power consumed by MSAN functionality, which is common to both Broadband DSL and POTS is split appropriately across the two functions. For those boards, such as combo interface board and combo main control board, which integrate Broadband DSL and POTS functions, the power consumption of these boards are to be measured separately for each function, i.e., measure Broadband DSL with POTS disabled and vice versa. In case the two functions cannot be fully disabled separately, the power values for each function can be declared in proportion according to the measured total power values.

(19.1) These figures are additive to those existing in the code of conduct section C.2(network equipment) for Broadband DSL to form the per port limit for combo operation.
(19.2) Note that this assumes that the port is equipped to supply POTS but has not been configured for use by an end customer.
(19.3) Note that this excludes any on-hook charging current, which may be drawn by the CPE (up to 3mA in some countries).

The above values are for fully equipped, maximum configuration MSAN with more than 128 ports. For equipment up to 128 ports (and with maximum configuration) 0.15 W per line may be added to the above values for the whole MSAN, with a minimum value of 5 W.
It is further assumed that power consumed by MSAN functionality which is common to both Broadband DSL and POTS is split appropriately across the two functions. For those boards, such as combo interface board and combo main control board, which integrate Broadband DSL and POTS functions, the power consumption of these boards are to be measured separately for each function, i.e., measure Broadband DSL with POTS disabled and vice versa. In case the two functions cannot be fully disabled separately, the power values for each function can be declared in proportion according to the measured total power values.
An additional allowance for each uplink interface is available from Table 18b.

The state of maturity of this technology is such that power targets can only apply to OLTs with the fiber technology implemented in ASIC. Signatories must report the power consumptions values of any OLT equipment that they manufacture or deploy, so that the state of development of this technology can be taken into account when revising these targets in the future. For OLTs with the fiber technology not implemented in ASIC, such report will not be included in the assessment of whether or not the 90% target has been achieved.

C.2.5 Cable Network Equipment
Cable network system vendors have developed the new Converged Cable Access Platform (CCAP) which incorporates multiple headend functionalities into a single piece of equipment. Suitable power metrics and targets for this equipment are now included in the Code of Conduct. Deployment of CCAP systems is currently replacing I-CMTS and M-CMTS equipment and this trend will continue throughout the next several years. Therefore investment in future power efficiency enhancements to legacy CMTS technology is not expected.

Table 27: Cable Network Equipment Definitions

CCAP

The Converged Cable Access Platform (CCAP) provides the layer 2 and layer 3 data forwarding services of a traditional CMTS and the video processing and modulation functions of an edge-QAM into a single platform. A CCAP can also support Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON) functionality, providing DOCSIS Provisioning of EPON (DPoE) services through access-side PON interfaces. The CCAP supports video services in the downstream and DOCSIS services in the downstream and upstream directions.
The CCAP is a full RF spectrum device, allowing 120 8-MHz QAM channels to be placed on the downstream for video and DOCSIS 3.0 services. In addition, the CCAP supports DOCSIS 3.1, allowing wider OFDM channels to be placed within the downstream spectrum. In the upstream, both DOCSIS 3.0 and 3.1 channels (OFDMA channels) are supported.
The platform is designed to be ultra-dense, meaning that the number of downstream RF interfaces in a CCAP is much greater than the number supplied on traditional headend equipment. The platform has a mid-plane architecture with active, replaceable line cards for data processing connected across the mid plane to passive physical interface cards (PICs) with RF interfaces. This allows line card redundancy and failover, as well as allowing line cards to be replaced without disconnecting cables from the RF interfaces on the PICs.
The combination of video and data processing, as well as the RF density of the CCAP, reduces the amount of equipment needed in the headend (CMTS, edgeQAM, and combining network).
Two useful entities are commonly used to characterize the essence of a CCAP. The first is the concept of a Service Group. A Service Group, for the purpose of this document, is defined as a subset of a CCAP chassis consisting of a single downstream RF port and two corresponding upstream RF ports or a single downstream RF port and a single corresponding upstream RF port. Multiple Service Groups are supported by a CCAP chassis with each Service Group typically serving about 500 to 1500 homes.
The second useful entity associated with a CCAP is the aspect of its data throughput, typically expressed in Gbps. This stems from the fact that a CCAP is

Broadband Equipment Code of Conduct – Version 6.0 46

February 10th 2017

fundamentally a routing platform. Since a CCAP implementation may not have symmetrical downstream/upstream throughput capabilities, throughput is often expressed as “downstream throughput” and separately as “upstream throughput”.
Note that modular CCAP and generations of CCAP equipment specifically targeted for Distributed Access Architectures (DAA) are out of scope for this document.

I-CMTS (Legacy equipment) A Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) forwards (at layer 2 or layer 3) data packets between a wide area network via its Network-side interfaces and customer premise equipment via its DOCSIS RF interface ports. In the case of an Integrated CMTS (I-CMTS), the downstream (DS) RF interfaces, upstream (US) RF interfaces, Network –side interfaces and associated control plane and data plane processing entities all reside within a single piece of equipment. An I-CMTS does not support, nor was it designed to support, MPEG video transport.

MCMTS

(Legacy equipment) In the case of a multi-unit, distributed-equipment CMTS (an M-CMTS), the interfaces and associated control plane and data plane processing entities are distributed among multiple pieces of equipment. The first of these, called an M-CMTS Core, is comprised of the upstream RF interfaces and the Network-side interfaces. All upstream and network-side control plane and data plane processing for those interfaces is also handled by the M-CMTS Core. Downstream MAC-layer processing is also performed on the M-CMTS Core.
A separate piece of equipment, the Edge-QAM, contains the M-CMTS downstream RF interface ports as well as network-side interfaces. The M-CMTS Core transmits downstream data content and control to the Edge-QAM across the Converged Interconnect Network (CIN) via the DOCSIS-defined DEPI interface (which is a form of an IP tunnel). The Edge-QAM then performs the downstream physicallayer processing necessary to modulate and transmit the data content of the downstream channel onto downstream RF port(s) toward the CM and CPE devices on the HFC network.
A third component, the DOCSIS Timing Server provides a common sense of timing and frequency to the other M-CMTS components via the DOCSIS Timing Interface (DTI).

C.2.5.1 CCAP Equipment
C.2.5.1.1 CCAP Power Consumption Metric The two metrics below are to be used to evaluate the power consumption characteristics of CCAP equipment. It is important to note that evaluation and consideration of both metrics is required in order to ensure a comprehensive understanding of these characteristics.

C.2.5.1.2 CCAP Power Consumption per Service Group
The CCAP power consumption per Service Group shall be determined with the metric specified in [29] – section 8.2.1.

C.2.5.1.3 CCAP Power Consumption per Throughput

Broadband Equipment Code of Conduct – Version 6.0 47

February 10th 2017

The CCAP power consumption per Throughput shall be determined as specified in [29] – section 8.2.2.

C.2.5.1.4 CCAP Power Consumption – Configuration
The configuration and test procedures specified in [29] – sections 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.5, and 10.8 (and their subsections) shall be applied in the evaluation of the CCAP power consumption metrics of section . The general testing standards and configuration specified in [28] shall also be applied. Note that configuration includes redundancy if supported by the CCAP equipment under test per [29] – section 10.2.

The above values are nominal at 25° C per downstream channel (or QAM) for a fully equipped chassis at its maximum configuration. Sparing features are not assumed. The

Broadband Equipment Code of Conduct – Version 6.0 48

February 10th 2017

assumed configuration for I-CMTS and M-CMTS Core includes a ratio of two upstream Service Groups paired with one downstream Service Group. It is assumed that the ratio of number of channels in an upstream Service Group to number of channels in a downstream Service Group is 1:4. For Edge-QAM, the assumed configuration is that all QAM channels are configured as DOCSIS downstream channels. These power numbers reflect the total chassis power divided by the number of downstream channels.

The optional DOCSIS Timing Interface (DTI) Server in an M-CMTS configuration is expected to consume at most 80 W.

REPORTING FORM

See Reporting Sheet on the homepage of the EU Standby Initiative [3].

The reporting spreadsheet should be filled in on the basis of equipment capability, in particular the actual number of ports on cards or chassis should be entered, regardless of any design or regulatory constraints which may result in the suboptimal use of those cards.

For Network Operators, the tier to be used for compliance purposes should be that pertaining to the year when equipment of a given type was ordered for the first time.

TEST METHODS

F.1 Customer premises equipment

Customer premises equipment with an external power supply shall be measured 230V AC input in all states (when existing) as they are described in section B.1. In the future, standardization bodies like ETSI could provide a more detailed specification for the measurement of the power consumption in different states.

F.2 Network equipment

The values given in section C.2 are indicating the averaged power consumption per port for a fully equipped system as delivered by the manufacturer.

Systems powered by DC voltage shall comply with the standard ETSI EN 300 132-2 [8].

The method of power measurement of equipment in line with point 0, C.2.2 and C.2.3 shall comply with the Technical Specification ETSI EN 303 215 [27]. The method of power measurement for equipment in line with point C.2.4 shall comply with the Technical Specification ETSI TS 202 706 static mode [16].

In case of systems powered directly by AC mains voltage, the power consumption will have to be measured at the AC input. For AC mains powered systems, the power limits stated in Table 16 through Table 26 are increased by 10%. In case of integrated remote or reverse powered systems, the power limits stated are increased by 15% for remote and 30% for reverse powered systems.

The power limits have to be fulfilled for the system operating at ambient temperature (25 ± 2° C). Fans, if present in network equipment in line with points 0 and C.2.2, have to be set at maximum speed.

Note: for both Customer premises and network equipment the xDSL test conditions under which energy consumption is measured should be representative of the scenario(s) under which network equipment or CPE is to be deployed (e.g., selection of band plan for VDSL2).The Broadband Forum and ETSI EE provide xDSL test plans, which may be used prior to the general availability of a unified test methodology which is fully compatible with the Code of Conduct.

In the spirit of industry harmonization, ETSI EE and the Broadband Forum will collaborate on the review/definition of the Broadband Energy efficiency measurement methods standards and test plans for xDSL CPE and network equipment published by ETSI with the aim of making joint recommendations for the next revision of the Code of Conduct.

EVOLUTION OF POWER SAVING FOR BROADBAND EQUIPMENT

The volume of deployed broadband equipment is increasing dramatically and so does its combined power consumption. Due to low customer aggregation ratios (typically, one CPE per customer), such equipment is typically idle most of the time, most of the time exchanging data only to maintain its network status. It is therefore evident that such equipment can be optimized in terms of its power consumption and activity profiles. Examples of such techniques include dynamic adaptation (e.g., performance scaling), smart standby (e.g., through proxying network presence and virtualization of functions) and energy aware management. The following list gives an overview of some of available optimization techniques.

• Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) as defined in IEEE Std 802.3-2012 SECTION SIX – wired copper Ethernet interfaces on CPEs have the ability to operate at a data rate lower than their nominal data rate, reducing power consumption of the interface as a whole. Different port-type-specific signalling mechanisms are used in EEE, including Low Power Idle. To take the full advantage of the EEE potential, both link peers must support EEE.

• Network Proxying defined by the ECMA task group under the work programme of TC38-TG4 - Proxying Support for Sleep Modes. The work is focused on providing support for the Network Proxy function for various types of broadband equipment, including VoIP phones. A proxy in this context is an entity that maintains network presence for a sleeping higher-power broadband device. A VoIP phone remains idle most of the time. VoIP phones cannot be put into a full standby mode, since they are required to maintain network presence through persistent data connectivity. Through proxying, another entity within the broadband network can assure such persistent data connectivity on behalf of a VoIP phone and wake it up when required. In this way, a device can enter a full standby mode, without any adverse effects on associated communication protocols.

• Energy aware management IETF EMAN. Provides a framework for Energy

Management for devices within or connected to communication networks, and

components thereof. It defines an Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy

Objects, for which each Energy Object is identified, classified and given context.

Energy Objects can be monitored and/or controlled with respect to Power, Power

State,

Energy,

Demand,

Power

Quality,

and

battery.

https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/eman/

• Energy aware management within ETSI - The Green Abstraction Layer (GAL) is an architectural interface/middleware that intends to give a flexible access to the power management capabilities of the future energy aware BroadBand nodes to effectively exploit the capability of adapting their energy consumption with respect to the function (typically the traffic) variations. The GAL aims at synthetizing and at correctly exposing power management capabilities and corresponding consumption variation.

Implementing those functions in broadband equipment enhances its capabilities for power saving.
